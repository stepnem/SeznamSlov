This plugin provides a single command, `seznamslov', scraping the online
dictionary at <http://slovnik.seznam.cz>, translating from Czech to
English|German|French|Spanish|Italian|Russian and the other way round.

Seems to work; any bug reports, feature requests etc. welcome (you can contact
the author at <stepnem AT gmail DOT com>).

You'll need BeautifulSoup to use the plugin.
